# Contract Verification Status

## Summary

The contract verification is failing because the bytecode of the deployed contracts doesn't match the current source code in your repository.

## Deployed Contracts on Celo Sepolia

1. **Address 1**: `0x5516d6bc563270Cbe27ca7Ed965cAA597130954A` (from Hardhat Ignition deployment)
2. **Address 2**: `0x534faf42dcd9bd13b76c7fd8f30ecd2e6bf821b5` (from sepolia-deployment.json)

## Issue

Both contracts fail verification with the error:

```
The address provided as argument contains a contract, but its bytecode doesn't match any of your local contracts.
```

## Root Cause

Based on your conversation history, you've made significant changes to the `CrosswordBoard.sol` contract including:

- Security fixes (reentrancy guards, access control improvements)
- Code refactoring
- Modularization attempts

The deployed contracts were likely deployed with an earlier version of the code, before these changes were made.

## Configuration Status

✅ **Hardhat Config**: Updated to use correct Etherscan v2 API endpoints
✅ **Compiler Version**: 0.8.28 (matches deployment)
✅ **Optimizer Settings**: Enabled with 200 runs (matches deployment)
✅ **API Key**: Present in .env file

## Solutions

### Option 1: Redeploy the Contract (Recommended)

Since you've made security improvements, it's best to deploy the current version:

1. **Deploy the updated contract**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/brito/crossword-app/celo-crossword/apps/contracts
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/CrosswordBoard.ts --network celoSepolia --parameters ignition/parameters.json
   ```

2. **Verify the newly deployed contract**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network celoSepolia <NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "0xA35Dc36B55D9A67c8433De7e790074ACC939f39e"
   ```

3. **Update your frontend** to use the new contract address

### Option 2: Verify with Old Source Code

If you need to verify the existing deployment:

1. Find the exact version of the code that was deployed (check git history around the deployment date)
2. Checkout that version
3. Compile and verify

### Option 3: Manual Verification via CeloScan UI

If automated verification continues to fail, you can verify manually:

1. Go to https://sepolia.celoscan.io/address/0x5516d6bc563270Cbe27ca7Ed965cAA597130954A#code
2. Click "Verify and Publish"
3. Select "Solidity (Single file)"
4. Compiler: v0.8.28+commit.7893614a
5. Optimization: Yes, 200 runs
6. Paste your flattened contract code
7. Constructor arguments (ABI-encoded): `0x00000000000000000000000066299c18c60ce709777ec79c73b131ce2634f58e`

## Recommended Action

**Deploy a new version** of the contract with your current security-improved code, then verify it. This ensures:

- Your security fixes are live
- The verified source code matches what's actually deployed
- Users can review the correct, secure code on CeloScan

## Command to Deploy New Contract

```bash
cd /Users/brito/crossword-app/celo-crossword/apps/contracts
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/CrosswordBoard.ts --network celoSepolia
```

After deployment, the new address will be shown. Use that address for verification.
